    "2 round before": "King-Six offsuit is weak in Round 1 due to lack of high pair or suited connectors. Facing Qwen3's $150 aggressive raise from $850 with $180 pot and two folds, high pressure suggests folding, but a cautious $150 call is made to potentially hit a strong draw on a very favorable flop, balancing risk with potential improvement through cautious strategy and neutral body language, prioritizing risk management over aggression with the hand's weakness.",
