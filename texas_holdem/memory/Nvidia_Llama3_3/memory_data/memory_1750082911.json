With a neutral pot size of 30 and no prior actions, being first to act is a disadvantage. Despite considering a cautious call due to the small pot and potential free flop look, the strategic conclusion leans towards folding to minimize loss. However, the player surprisingly chooses to **call (20)**, expressing calmness: \"glances briefly at opponent, then back to chips before pushing them forward calmly\" 'Staying in the game for now.' This action contrasts the initial strategic thought, opting for aggression over caution, possibly to disguise hand strength or probe opponents' reactions, adding a layer of psychological play. "
