    "1 round before": "\nAnalyzing \"King-Six offsuit\" in Round 1, the hand is weak due to lack of high pair potential and suited connectors, relying on unlikely flush or straight draws. Facing Qwen3's aggressive $150 raise from an $850 stack, indicating potential strong hand or bluff, with a pot of $180 and two preceding folds, pressure is high. Strategic considerations suggest folding to minimize loss, but a cautious call is possible to potentially hit a strong draw on the flop, requiring a very favorable board to continue. A call of $150 is chosen with a neutral expression: *glances at opponent, then back at cards* \"Seeing it through for now,\" aiming to maintain neutrality, appear thoughtful, and incorporate subtle poker body language. This approach balances caution with the potential for improvement, weighing the risks of aggression against the benefits of patience. The decision reflects a cautious strategy, prioritizing risk management over speculative play, given the hand's inherent weakness and the opponent's demonstrated aggression. (243 words)\n"
