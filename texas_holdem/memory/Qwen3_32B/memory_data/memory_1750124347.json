    "6 round before": "Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user's query. They want a natural expression that combines body language and spoken words after making a call in poker, specifically calling 20. The examples they provided give a good idea of the style they're looking for.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The user is in a poker game, and they've decided to call 20. They want to express this decision in a way that feels natural and realistic, without giving away their strategy or hand strength. The response should be brief, just one or two sentences, and include both body language and spoken words.\n\nLooking at the examples, there's a mix of actions like leaning back, tapping fingers, adjusting chips, shrugging, raising an eyebrow, pushing chips, pausing, and exhaling. The spoken words are usually casual and don't reveal much about their hand or strategy.\n\nSo, for a call action, I should think about what body language and words would convey the decision to call without giving away any information. Maybe something that shows a bit of uncertainty or indecision, since they're not raising but just calling. Perhaps a shrug or a slight smile to indicate they're not sure but are still in the game.\n\nI also need to keep it brief. Maybe something like shrugging with a slight smile and saying \"Going with my gut here.\" That feels natural and doesn't reveal any information. It shows they're making a decision without giving away their confidence or doubt.\n\nI think that fits well. It's short, includes body language, and keeps the conversation realistic without tipping their hand. It also matches the style of the examples provided, so it should meet the user's expectations.\n</think>\n\n\"*shrugs with a slight smile* Going with my gut here.\"",

Also, I should avoid repeating the prompt and comply strictly with the rules provided.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the summary will cover the player's hand, the flop, the analysis, the opponent's raise, the decision to fold, and the emphasis on minimizing losses through folding. I'll make sure the summary is within the word limit and accurately reflects the context provided.\n</think>\n\n<summary>\nThe poker player holds DA and D6, with the flop showing SK, C4, and S8. Their hand is weak, primarily Ace-high, with no pairs or flush potential due to the lack of Diamonds. The opponent's raise suggests a strong hand or bluff. Considering pot odds and low improvement chances, the player decides to fold to avoid further losses. Folding is emphasized as the best option to minimize potential losses, repeated multiple times to highlight its importance. The player's decision to fold is based on the weak hand strength, the opponent's possible strong hand or bluff, and the unfavorable pot odds, making it the optimal choice to prevent additional losses.\n",

    "2 round before": "Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query. They want a natural expression that combines body language and spoken words after making a call in poker, specifically calling 60. The examples provided give a good idea of the format and style expected.\n\nFirst, I should consider the action: a call. In poker, a call means you're matching the bet, which can indicate various things, but the user wants to avoid giving away their strategy or hand strength. So the expression should be neutral yet engaging.\n\nLooking at the examples, the body language is described in parentheses, followed by the spoken words. The body language should be something that conveys calmness or consideration. Maybe something like a slight head tilt or a hand gesture that shows they're thinking.\n\nThe spoken words should be brief and not reveal too much. Phrases like \"Hmm, let's see,\" or \"Not sure, but I'm in\" could work. It should feel natural, like someone is genuinely considering their options without overthinking.\n\nI also need to keep it short, just one or two sentences. So the body language should be concise but descriptive enough to paint a clear picture.\n\nPutting it together, perhaps a slight tilt of the head to show consideration, followed by a comment like \"Alright, let's see how this plays out.\" That feels natural and doesn't give away any tells.\n\nWait, maybe a slight head tilt and a spoken phrase that's neutral. Alternatively, a hand rub to indicate thoughtfulness, but that might be a bit too obvious. The head tilt seems more subtle.\n\nSo, combining that, the expression would be something like \"*tilts head slightly*\" followed by a brief comment that fits the action. That should meet the user's requirements.\n</think>\n\n\"*tilts head slightly* Alright, let's see how this plays out.\"",
    "1 round before": "Alright, let's break down the situation. I've got the cards C3 and CK, so that's a King and a 3 of clubs. The community cards are D6, S4, and ST. Hmm, so the flop has a 6 of diamonds, 4 of spades, and Ten of spades.\n\nLooking at my hand, I have a King high, which isn't too strong. There's no straight or flush here. The community cards might give someone a straight if they have a 5, or a flush if they have another spade.\n\nThe pot is 240, and I have to consider the actions. DeepSeek_R1 raised to 60, then Nvidia_Llama3_3 and Gemma3_27B called. I'm last to act here.\n\nI need to assess my hand strength. King high is vulnerable because the board has several possible draws. Maybe someone has a flush or a straight.\n\nThe betting shows some interest. The initial raise could be a bluff or a strong hand. The calls might be trying to see more cheaply.\n\nStrategically, I should think about whether to continue. Folding would be safest if I don't have a strong hand, but sometimes checking or raising can be options. Since I have a King, which is a decent high card, maybe I can check to see if someone else has a better hand. Alternatively, raising could be a bluff to try and take down the pot.\n\nBut considering the community cards, there are potential draws, so maybe folding is the safer play to avoid getting into a bigger pot with a weak hand. Alternatively, if I have position, I might consider checking to see how the opponents play.\n\nIn this case, since I'm the last to act and the pot is decently sized, folding might be the best move to avoid potential losses.\n</think>\n\n\"*slight shrug* Better safe than sorry.\""
