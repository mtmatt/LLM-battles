    "2 round before": "Alright, let me try to figure out how to respond to the user's query. They want a natural expression that combines body language and spoken words after making a raise in poker. The examples they provided give a good sense of the style they're looking for.\n\nFirst, I should consider typical body language associated with raising in poker. Maybe something that shows confidence without giving away too much. Leaning forward can indicate engagement or confidence.\n\nNext, the spoken words should be concise and not reveal too much about the hand. Phrases like \"Let's see what develops\" are good because they're neutral and don't give away any information.\n\nI should also make sure the response is brief, as per the instructions, and formatted correctly with the body language in italics followed by the spoken words.\n\nPutting it all together, something like leaning forward with a determined look and saying the chosen phrase should work well. It fits the examples and meets the user's requirements without overcomplicating things.\n</think>\n\n\"*leans forward slightly, eyes focused* Let's see what develops.\"",
    "1 round before": "Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this user's query. They want a natural expression that includes both body language and spoken words after folding in poker. The examples they provided are pretty helpful. I see that each example combines a specific body action with a concise statement. For instance, leaning back and saying something about seeing what happens.\n\nThe user specifically mentioned that the response should be brief, realistic, and not reveal any strategy or hand strength. So, I shouldn't use anything that gives away whether the hand was weak or strong. It needs to be neutral.\n\nLooking at the examples, the body language is usually a verb phrase, like \"leans back\" or \"taps fingers.\" The spoken words are usually a short phrase that doesn't give away much. For a fold action, which is when a player decides not to continue, the body language might indicate some hesitation or uncertainty.\n\nMaybe something like a slight shrug, which shows that the decision wasn't easy. The spoken words could be something like \"Better safe than sorry.\" That's a common phrase and doesn't reveal any specifics about the hand.\n\nPutting it together, the format would be \"*slight shrug* Better safe than sorry.\" This fits the criteria: it's brief, includes body language, and doesn't give away any strategy.\n\nI should make sure that the body language is subtle but noticeable, and the words are casual enough to sound natural in a poker setting. It shouldn't seem forced or overly dramatic. A slight shrug is a common and believable action when someone is folding, especially if they're unsure about their hand.\n\nI also need to ensure that the response doesn't follow any of the examples exactly, so it's original. The examples have things like leaning back, tapping fingers, adjusting chips, etc. A slight shrug is different enough, so it should be okay.\n\nIn summary, combining a slight shrug with a phrase indicating caution fits the requirements for a natural fold expression without revealing any strategic info.\n</think>\n\n\"*slight shrug* Better safe than sorry.\""
