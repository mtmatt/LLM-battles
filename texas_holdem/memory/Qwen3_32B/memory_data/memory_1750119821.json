    "4 round before": "Alright, let me try to figure out how to respond to the user's query. They want a natural expression that combines body language and spoken words after making a raise in poker. The examples they provided give a good sense of the style they're looking for.\n\nFirst, I should consider typical body language associated with raising in poker. Maybe something that shows confidence without giving away too much. Leaning forward can indicate engagement or confidence.\n\nNext, the spoken words should be concise and not reveal too much about the hand. Phrases like \"Let's see what develops\" are good because they're neutral and don't give away any information.\n\nI should also make sure the response is brief, as per the instructions, and formatted correctly with the body language in italics followed by the spoken words.\n\nPutting it all together, something like leaning forward with a determined look and saying the chosen phrase should work well. It fits the examples and meets the user's requirements without overcomplicating things.\n</think>\n\n\"*leans forward slightly, eyes focused* Let's see what develops.\"",
    "3 round before": "Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user's query. They want a natural expression that includes both body language and spoken words after folding in poker. The examples they provided are pretty helpful. Each example combines a specific body action with a concise statement. For instance, leaning back and saying something about seeing what happens.\n\nThe user specifically mentioned that the response should be brief, realistic, and not reveal any strategy or hand strength. So, I shouldn't use anything that gives away whether the hand was weak or strong. It needs to be neutral.\n\nLooking at the examples, the body language is usually a verb phrase, like \"leans back\" or \"taps fingers.\" The spoken words are usually a short phrase that doesn't give away much. For a fold action, which is when a player decides not to continue, the body language might indicate some hesitation or uncertainty.\n\nMaybe something like a slight shrug, which shows that the decision wasn't easy. The spoken words could be something like \"Better safe than sorry.\" That's a common phrase and doesn't reveal any specifics about the hand.\n\nPutting it together, the format would be \"*slight shrug* Better safe than sorry.\" This fits the criteria: it's brief, includes body language, and doesn't give away any strategy.\n\nI should make sure that the body language is subtle but noticeable, and the words are casual enough to sound natural in a poker setting. It shouldn't seem forced or overly dramatic. A slight shrug is a common and believable action when someone is folding, especially if they're unsure about their hand.\n\nI also need to ensure that the response doesn't follow any of the examples exactly, so it's original. The examples have things like leaning back, tapping fingers, adjusting chips, etc. A slight shrug is different enough, so it should be okay.\n\nIn summary, combining a slight shrug with a phrase indicating caution fits the requirements for a natural fold expression without revealing any strategic info.\n</think>\n\n\"*slight shrug* Better safe than sorry.\"",
    "2 round before": " tags and is exactly 13 words. So, I should follow that structure. The content seems to be about a competition or a match where Nvidia_Llama3_3 won Round 1. \n\nI need to ensure that the summary captures the essential information: the round number, the winner, and the outcome. Since the word quota is strict, I'll have to choose the most impactful words without any fluff. \n\nAlso, the user emphasized not repeating the prompt and just complying with the rules. So, I should focus solely on generating the summary without any additional explanations or text. \n\nIn summary, my task is to condense the given information into a 13-word summary, wrapped in the specified tags, ensuring it's accurate and meets all the constraints provided.\n</think>\n\n<summary>Round 1 ended with Nvidia_Llama3_3 as the winner.",
    "1 round before": " tags. That's straightforward, but I should remember to include those without any extra text.\n\nThe user emphasized outputting directly without repeating the prompt, so I shouldn't include any explanations or additional information beyond the summary itself.\n\nLooking at the content, I see that Gemma3_27B and DeepSeek_R1 both folded, while Nvidia_Llama3_3 called twice. The times are included, but since the word quota is tight, I might need to simplify the timestamps or just mention the actions without the exact times to save space.\n\nI'll draft a sentence that includes all three opponents and their actions, making sure it's concise. Let me try: \"In Round 2, Gemma3_27B and DeepSeek_R1 folded, while Nvidia_Llama3_3 called twice.\" That's 16 words. Hmm, I can add the times to reach 18. Maybe: \"In Round 2, Gemma3_27B and DeepSeek_R1 folded, while Nvidia_Llama3_3 called twice at specific times.\" That's 18 words. Perfect.\n\nI should double-check to ensure all constraints are met: exactly 18 words, based on context, wrapped in tags, and output directly. Everything looks good.\n</think>\n\n<summary>In Round 2, Gemma3_27B and DeepSeek_R1 folded, while Nvidia_Llama3_3 called twice at specific times."
