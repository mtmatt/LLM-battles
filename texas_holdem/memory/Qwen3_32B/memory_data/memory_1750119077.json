    "1 round before": "Alright, let me try to figure out how to respond to the user's query. They want a natural expression that combines body language and spoken words after making a raise in poker. The examples they provided give a good sense of the style they're looking for.\n\nFirst, I should consider typical body language associated with raising in poker. Maybe something that shows confidence without giving away too much. Leaning forward can indicate engagement or confidence.\n\nNext, the spoken words should be concise and not reveal too much about the hand. Phrases like \"Let's see what develops\" are good because they're neutral and don't give away any information.\n\nI should also make sure the response is brief, as per the instructions, and formatted correctly with the body language in italics followed by the spoken words.\n\nPutting it all together, something like leaning forward with a determined look and saying the chosen phrase should work well. It fits the examples and meets the user's requirements without overcomplicating things.\n</think>\n\n\"*leans forward slightly, eyes focused* Let's see what develops.\""
