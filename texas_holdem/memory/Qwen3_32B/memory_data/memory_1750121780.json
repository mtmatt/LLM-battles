The examples they provided give a good sense of the style they're looking for.\n\nFirst, I should consider typical body language associated with raising in poker. Maybe something that shows confidence without giving away too much. Leaning forward can indicate engagement or confidence.\n\nNext, the spoken words should be concise and not reveal too much about the hand. Phrases like \"Let's see what develops\" are good because they're neutral and don't give away any information.\n\nI should also make sure the response is brief, as per the instructions, and formatted correctly with the body language in italics followed by the spoken words.\n\nPutting it all together, something like leaning forward with a determined look and saying the chosen phrase should work well. It fits the examples and meets the user's requirements without overcomplicating things.\n</think>\n\n\"*leans forward slightly, eyes focused* Let's see what develops.\"",
    "7 round before": "Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user's query. They want a natural expression that includes both body language and spoken words after folding in poker. The examples they provided are pretty helpful. Each example combines a specific body action with a concise statement. For instance, leaning back and saying something about seeing what happens.\n\nThe user specifically mentioned that the response should be brief, realistic, and not reveal any strategy or hand strength. So, I shouldn't use anything that gives away whether the hand was weak or strong. It needs to be neutral.\n\nLooking at the examples, the body language is usually a verb phrase, like \"leans back\" or \"taps fingers.\" The spoken words are usually a short phrase that doesn't give away much. For a fold action, which is when a player decides not to continue, the body language might indicate some hesitation or uncertainty.\n\nMaybe something like a slight shrug, which shows that the decision wasn't easy. The spoken words could be something like \"Better safe than sorry.\" That's a common phrase and doesn't reveal any specifics about the hand.\n\nPutting it together, the format would be \"*slight shrug* Better safe than sorry.\" This fits the criteria: it's brief, includes body language, and doesn't give away any strategy.\n\nI should make sure that the body language is subtle but noticeable, and the words are casual enough to sound natural in a poker setting. It shouldn't seem forced or overly dramatic. A slight shrug is a common and believable action when someone is folding, especially if they're unsure about their hand.\n\nI also need to ensure that the response doesn't follow any of the examples exactly, so it's original. The examples have things like leaning back, tapping fingers, adjusting chips, etc. A slight shrug is different enough, so it should be okay.\n\nIn summary, combining a slight shrug with a phrase indicating caution fits the requirements for a natural fold expression without revealing any strategic info.\n</think>\n\n\"*slight shrug* Better safe than sorry.\"",
    "6 round before": " tags, and output directly without any extra text.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the content correctly. The main points are that Round 1 has ended and Nvidia_Llama3_3 won. I should capture both these elements in the summary.\n\nNext, I have to fit this into exactly 8 words. Let me try a few versions. \"Round 1 concluded with Nvidia_Llama3_3 as the winner.\" That's 8 words. Perfect. It includes both the conclusion of the round and the winner.\n\nI also need to ensure that the summary is accurate and doesn't add any extra information. Since the original text is straightforward, I don't need to elaborate. Just a concise statement.\n\nFinally, I'll wrap it in the required tags. So the final output should be <summary>Round 1 concluded with Nvidia_Llama3_3 as the winner.",

    "4 round before": "Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to this user's query. They want a natural expression that combines body language and spoken words after making a call in poker, specifically calling 20. The examples they provided give a good idea of the style they're looking for.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The user is in a poker game, and they've decided to call 20. They want to express this decision in a way that feels natural and realistic, without giving away their strategy or hand strength. The response should be brief, just one or two sentences, and include both body language and spoken words.\n\nLooking at the examples, there's a mix of actions like leaning back, tapping fingers, adjusting chips, shrugging, raising an eyebrow, pushing chips, pausing, and exhaling. The spoken words are usually casual and don't reveal much about their hand or strategy.\n\nSo, for a call action, I should think about what body language and words would convey the decision to call without giving away any information. Maybe something that shows a bit of uncertainty or indecision, since they're not raising but just calling. Perhaps a shrug or a slight smile to indicate they're not sure but are still in the game.\n\nI also need to keep it brief. Maybe something like shrugging with a slight smile and saying \"Going with my gut here.\" That feels natural and doesn't reveal any information. It shows they're making a decision without giving away their confidence or doubt.\n\nI think that fits well. It's short, includes body language, and keeps the conversation realistic without tipping their hand. It also matches the style of the examples provided, so it should meet the user's expectations.\n</think>\n\n\"*shrugs with a slight smile* Going with my gut here.\"",
    "3 round before": " tags as instructed. No markdown, just plain text. I'll avoid repeating the prompt and keep the language straightforward.\n\nLet me draft it: mention the player's hand, the flop, the weak hand, opponent's raise, pot odds, low improvement chances, and the decision to fold. I'll check the word count to make sure it's exactly 101.\n\nAfter drafting, I'll review to ensure it flows naturally and covers all necessary points without exceeding the word limit. Once satisfied, I'll present the summary within the tags as required.\n</think>\n\n<summary>The poker player holds DA and D6, with the flop showing SK, C4, and S8. Their hand is weak, primarily Ace-high, with no pairs or flush potential due to the lack of Diamonds. The opponent's raise suggests a strong hand or bluff.

Folding is the best option to minimize potential losses.",
    "2 round before": " tags. I need to remember to include those without any additional text or formatting.\n\nAnother important point is that the output should be direct, without repeating the prompt. That means I shouldn't include any explanations or extra information beyond the summary itself.\n\nAdditionally, the user emphasized simply complying with the rules, so I should focus on following each instruction without adding any personal touches or deviations.\n\nNow, considering the word quota of 17, I need to craft a sentence that includes all necessary information within that limit. Let me try a few versions:\n\n1. \"Round 2 has ended. The winner is Gemma3_27B.\" \u2013 This is 14 words. It's concise but might be able to be more precise.\n\n2. \"Round 2 concluded with Gemma3_27B as the winner.\" \u2013 This is 10 words. It's shorter but still within the limit. However, it might be possible to make it even more concise.\n\n3. \"Round 2 ended; Gemma3_27B won.\" \u2013 This is 8 words. It's very concise but might be too brief.\n\nWait, the user's example response was 14 words, but the word quota was 17. Maybe I can make it a bit longer to use up the quota without adding unnecessary information.\n\n4. \"Round 2 has concluded, and the winner is Gemma3_27B.\" \u2013 This is 12 words. Still under 17.\n\n5. \"Round 2 has come to an end, with Gemma3_27B emerging as the winner.\" \u2013 This is 14 words. It's more detailed and uses more words.\n\nI think the user's example was 14 words, but the quota was 17, so perhaps I can make it a bit longer. Let me try to add a bit more detail without being redundant.\n\n6. \"Round 2 has officially ended, and the winner of the competition is Gemma3_27B.\" \u2013 This is 16 words. Close to the limit.\n\n7. \"Round 2 has officially ended, and the competition winner is Gemma3_27B.\" \u2013 This is 14 words.\n\nAlternatively, I can structure it differently to use more words.\n\n8. \"Round 2 has concluded, and the title of winner goes to Gemma3_27B.\" \u2013 This is 13 words.\n\nHmm, it's a bit tricky to reach exactly 17 words without adding unnecessary information. Maybe I can include a bit more context without deviating from the main points.\n\n9. \"Round 2 has ended, and after a fierce competition, Gemma3_27B was declared the winner.\" \u2013 This is 15 words.\n\n10. \"Round 2 has ended, and following a competitive round, Gemma3_27B emerged victorious.\" \u2013 This is 14 words.\n\nI think the key is to include all necessary information without exceeding the word limit. The user's example was 14 words, but the quota was 17, so perhaps a slightly longer version is acceptable.\n\nAfter considering all these options, I think the best approach is to make sure the summary is clear, concise, and fits within the word limit. I'll go with a version that is around 14 words, as it effectively communicates the necessary information without being too verbose.\n</think>\n\n<summary>Round 2 has ended. The winner is Gemma3_27B.",
