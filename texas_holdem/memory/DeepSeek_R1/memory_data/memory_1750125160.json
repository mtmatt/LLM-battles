    "8 round before": "Nvidia's Llama3_3 won the first round of competition.",
    "7 round before": "Qwen raised 150; Nvidia called then folded in Round 2.",
    "6 round before": "Weak H6/10\u2666 faces 50 pot; fold preserves stack due to poor equity.",
    "5 round before": "Gemma3_27B was declared as the winner of round two.",
    "4 round before": "Gemma3 upgraded, Qwen3 and Nvidia_Llama3 discontinued.",
    "3 round before": "KJo is moderately strong but vulnerable multi-way. With a 30 pot and first action, folding is too tight; calling invites opponents. Raise 3-4x (90-120) to isolate 1-2 players, build value, leverage fold equity, and prevent cheap flops. Fold to significant re-raises without reads. Action: raise(60).",
    "2 round before": "Holding top pair DK on dry D6/S4/ST flop with DJ kicker and backdoor flush. Opponents passively called pre-flop; pot 240, no aggression suggests weak pairs/draws. Optimal: raise ~180 to charge draws, isolate one player, define ranges (folding weak, calling risky). Action taken: minimal call(\"call(0)\") with shrug/verbalization \"Guess I'll stay in for now,\" contradicting raise rationale.",
    "1 round before": "Player holds top pair (King), calls the bet with a relaxed posture, resting arms on the table. They state \"Alright, let's keep this going,\" lightly tap fingers beside chips, and say \"I'll ride along for now.\""
