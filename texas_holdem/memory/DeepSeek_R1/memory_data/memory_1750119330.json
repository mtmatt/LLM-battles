    "1 round before": "Holding Q\u2666 and 2\u2660, a very weak offsuit hand with minimal value and high domination risk, facing a raise to 150 creating a 180 pot. Calling requires 150 chips for 2.2:1 pot odds, but the hand lacks implied odds or showdown value. Folding is correct to preserve chips, as investing 150 carries high risk of being outkicked or crushed post-flop without justification. The decision is to fold immediately."
