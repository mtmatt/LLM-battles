The pot is small relative to stack sizes, meaning there's not much incentive to gamble on a flop that likely won't improve me. \n\nI'm leaning heavily towards folding, as any raise will almost certainly put me in a difficult spot. Calling is technically an option, but I'd be hoping for a lucky flop and playing a very tight game post-flop, which isn't ideal with this hand.",
