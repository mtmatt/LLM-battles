    "4 round before": "The player discarded a weak hand (4-2 offsuit) preflop due to low stakes and small stacks. Raising was deemed too risky, while calling required a very selective post-flop approach given the hand's low chance of winning.",
    "3 round before": "Nvidia Llama3_3 won the first round of the competition.",
    "2 round before": "Qwen3 reached 150, DeepSeek_R1 and Nvidia_Llama3_3 followed, then folded. Qwen3 also folded, concluding the round.",
    "1 round before": "\nThe player holds CKH3, a weak preflop hand with limited potential, now heads-up against Qwen3 and Nvidia_Llama3_3 after DeepSeek_R1 folded. Opponents calling a 20 raise suggests decent hands, not premiums. A raise is deemed unwise, and folding too conservative. Therefore, the player chooses to call the 20, seeking a cheap flop to improve their hand and assess the situation further. The action reflects a cautious, exploratory approach.\n"
