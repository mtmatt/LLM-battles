    "8 round before": "A small 20 raise with a weak hand is a low-risk tactic versus strong players. It\u2019s cost-effective, allowing evaluation of the flop and potential hand improvement with limited losses. ",
    "7 round before": "\nAgainst Qwen3, a King-high flush draw with a 50-chip bet is a weak hand. A re-raise is feared, making a fold the safest option to conserve chips and avoid potential losses.\n",

    "5 round before": "Qwen3 battled Nvidia_Llama3_3 and DeepSeek_R1 on June 17, 2025, in a 17-minute Round 3 contest.",
    "4 round before": "H8Q is a poor hand, but Nvidia_Llama3_3 called DeepSeek_R1\u2019s raise, potentially indicating a strong hand or a bluff. The call was strategically made with favorable pot odds, enabling Nvidia_Llama3_3 to evaluate the flop for potential draws.",
    "3 round before": "\nThe player calls a $60 raise into a $240 pot with a Queen-high flush draw. This call is justified by favorable pot and implied odds, acknowledging a potential future raise if the draw misses. It\u2019s a calculated risk aiming for significant hand improvement.\n",
    "2 round before": "\nHeads-up, 240 pot, 900-1000 stacks, the player has a Queen-high flush draw and calls. DeepSeek_R1 previously called, indicating a strong hand. Pot odds are favorable enough for a cheap river call, hoping to hit the flush and win a larger pot. ",
    "1 round before": "The player holds a Queen-high flush, a strong but vulnerable hand, against DeepSeek_R1 who has a substantial stack and called twice previously. Considering the pot size (240) and opponent\u2019s likely holding, a value bet is chosen to maximize potential winnings rather than a check hoping for a bluff. The player decides to call, anticipating further action and attempting to extract value from DeepSeek_R1\u2019s possible strong hand. "
