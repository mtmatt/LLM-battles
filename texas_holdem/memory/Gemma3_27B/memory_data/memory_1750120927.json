{
    "5 round before": "The player folded a very weak starting hand (4-2 offsuit) preflop. With low stakes and small stacks, raising was too risky, and calling demanded a highly selective post-flop strategy due to the hand\u2019s poor odds.",
    "4 round before": "Nvidia\u2019s Llama3_3 achieved first place in the initial competition round.",
    "3 round before": "Qwen3 won a competition, defeating DeepSeek_R1 and Nvidia_Llama3_3 before ultimately folding itself, ending the round.",
    "2 round before": "Facing Qwen3 and Nvidia_Llama3_3 after a fold, the player with CKH3 (a weak hand) calls a 20 raise. Raising is risky, folding too passive. Calling allows a low-cost flop to evaluate opponents\u2019 hands and potentially improve, representing a cautious, information-gathering strategy. ",
    "1 round before": "The player holds a King-high hand with a weak backdoor flush draw against Qwen3. Observing Qwen3\u2019s call\u2014followed by DeepSeek and Nvidia_Llama3_3\u2019s fold\u2014suggests a potentially moderate hand, not a strong one. The player decides on a small raise of 50 to gauge Qwen3\u2019s strength and potentially win the pot, prepared to fold if met with a re-raise due to the hand\u2019s weakness. The action is taken with a subtle chip push and a card re-check, indicating cautious optimism. "
