    "8 round before": "Qwen3 surpassed DeepSeek_R1 and Llama3_3 before evaluation halted.",
    "7 round before": "A small 20 raise with a weak hand is a low-risk play against strong opponents. It\u2019s cheaper than folding or betting heavily, enabling flop evaluation and potential hand improvement while minimizing losses. ",
    "6 round before": "Facing Qwen3 post-flop, the player has a King-high flush draw. A 50-chip bet causes concern, anticipating a re-raise. The hand is considered weak, and a fold is likely to minimize risk and protect chips. ",
    "5 round before": "Gemma3_27B won the second round of the competition.",
    "4 round before": "Round 3, June 17, 2025, pitted Qwen3 against Nvidia_Llama3_3 and DeepSeek_R1, lasting 17 minutes.",
    "3 round before": "H8Q is a weak starting hand. DeepSeek_R1\u2019s raise was called by Nvidia_Llama3_3, suggesting possible strength or a bluff attempt. The call, with good pot odds, allows Nvidia_Llama3_3 to assess the flop for draws like straights or flushes.",
    "2 round before": "The player calls a 60 raise into a 240 pot with a Queen-high flush draw. While risky, the pot odds and potential implied odds justify the call, despite the possibility of a future raise if the draw doesn\u2019t complete. It\u2019s a calculated gamble based on hand improvement potential.",
    "1 round before": "In a heads-up situation with a 240 pot and 900-1000 effective stacks, the player holds a Queen-high flush draw but no pair. DeepSeek_R1 called a previous bet, suggesting some hand strength. The player assesses pot odds and considers raising to build the pot, but ultimately decides on a call to see the river cheaply, hoping to complete the flush. The action taken is a call. "
