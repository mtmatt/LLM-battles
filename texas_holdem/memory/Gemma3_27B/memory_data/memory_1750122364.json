    "7 round before": "The player proactively folded a very weak hand (4-2 offsuit) pre-flop. Raising was risky at these stakes, and calling demanded a strong, specific post-flop strategy due to the hand's minimal potential.",
    "6 round before": "Nvidia\u2019s Llama3_3 won the first competition round, securing the top rank.",
    "5 round before": "Qwen3 won against DeepSeek_R1 and Llama3_3, then unexpectedly ended its run.",
    "4 round before": "A small 20 raise with a weak hand (CKH3) against strong players (Qwen3, Nvidia_Llama3_3) is a strategic gamble. It\u2019s cheaper than larger raises or folding, allowing a low-cost flop to evaluate opponents and improve the hand\u2019s potential.",
    "3 round before": "The player holds a King-high with a weak flush draw against Qwen3. Qwen3 called, suggesting a middling hand, while others folded. A 50-chip raise tests Qwen3, but the player is prepared to fold to a re-raise, acknowledging hand weakness and prioritizing caution.",
    "2 round before": "Gemma3_27B won Round 2 of the competition.",
    "1 round before": "\nRound 3 saw Qwen3 and Nvidia_Llama3_3 both call and fold. DeepSeek_R1 only folded. Actions occurred between 08:28:10 and 08:45:00 on June 17, 2025.\n"
