    "2 round before": "The player folded a very weak starting hand (4-2 offsuit) preflop due to the small pot and stack sizes. Raising was deemed too risky, and calling would require a restrictive post-flop game. The quick fold recognized the hand's lack of potential.",
    "1 round before": "Round 1 concluded; Nvidia_Llama3_3 won."
