    "8 round before": "Against Qwen3, a King-high flush draw with a 50-chip bet is vulnerable. A re-raise is likely, so folding is recommended to protect your chip stack and minimize risk of significant loss.",
    "7 round before": "Gemma3_27B won the second round of the competition.",
    "6 round before": "Qwen3 competed against Nvidia_Llama3_3 and DeepSeek_R1 in a 17-minute Round 3 contest on June 17, 2025.",
    "5 round before": "Nvidia_Llama3_3 called DeepSeek_R1\u2019s raise with a weak hand (H8Q), suggesting confidence or a bluff. The call leveraged good pot odds, allowing Nvidia_Llama3_3 to assess the flop for improving their hand with potential draws.",
    "4 round before": "The player calls a $60 raise into a $240 pot with a Queen-high flush draw, justified by pot and implied odds. This call anticipates a possible future raise if the draw doesn\u2019t complete, representing a calculated risk for a potentially strong hand.",
    "3 round before": "In a 240 pot with 900-1000 stacks, a player with a Queen-high flush draw calls. DeepSeek_R1 also called, suggesting strength. Favorable pot odds justify a low-cost river call to complete the flush and potentially win a bigger pot.",
    "2 round before": "The player, with a Queen-high flush, value bets against DeepSeek_R1, who has a large stack and demonstrated prior interest. A check risked a missed opportunity for value, given the 240 pot and opponent\u2019s potential strength. The player calls, expecting continued aggression and aiming to win more.",
    "1 round before": "Facing a 120 chip call against DeepSeek_R1\u2019s river raise of 120 into a 360 pot, the player holds a Queen-high flush. While a made hand, it\u2019s vulnerable to stronger flushes. A raise is considered too aggressive without range information, and folding seems weak. The player opts to call, hoping to win the pot but prepared to fold if facing further bets. The decision is made with slight hesitation, acknowledging the risk while pursuing potential reward. "
