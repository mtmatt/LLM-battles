    "6 round before": "A small 20 raise with a weak hand is a low-risk gamble against strong players. It\u2019s less expensive than folding or betting big, allowing evaluation of opponents and potential hand improvement on the flop without substantial loss.",
    "5 round before": "The player holds a King-high flush draw against Qwen3, who called preflop. A 50-chip bet prompts caution; the player anticipates a potential re-raise and is prepared to fold, acknowledging the hand's weakness and prioritizing risk management.",
    "4 round before": "Gemma3_27B won the competition\u2019s second round.",
    "3 round before": "\nRound 3 featured Qwen3, Nvidia_Llama3_3 (calling/folding), and DeepSeek_R1 (folding) on June 17, 2025, from 08:28:10-08:45:00.\n",
    "2 round before": "H8Q is a marginal preflop hand. DeepSeek_R1 raised 60, called by Nvidia_Llama3_3, possibly indicating strength or a steal. Nvidia_Llama3_3\u2019s call is strategically reasonable to evaluate the flop for potential straights or flushes, given favorable pot odds. ",
    "1 round before": "The player holds a Queen-high flush draw, a decent but vulnerable hand, facing a 60 raise on a 240 pot. Pot odds are reasonable enough to continue, considering potential implied odds if the flush completes. Despite caution about a possible turn raise if the draw misses, the player chooses to call, hoping to improve their hand on the next card. The decision reflects a calculated risk based on hand potential and betting dynamics. "
