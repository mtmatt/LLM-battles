    "6 round before": "The player discarded a very weak hand (4-2 offsuit) before any betting. Raising was too dangerous with the low stakes, and calling required a precise post-flop plan given the hand\u2019s low potential.",
    "5 round before": "Nvidia\u2019s Llama3_3 won the first competition round, achieving top ranking.",
    "4 round before": "Qwen3 triumphed over DeepSeek_R1 and Nvidia\u2019s Llama3_3 in a competition, then self-terminated the round.",
    "3 round before": "With a weak hand (CKH3), calling a 20 raise against strong opponents (Qwen3, Nvidia_Llama3_3) is a calculated risk. It avoids costly raises or passive folds, enabling a cheap flop to assess opponents and potentially improve the hand. ",
    "2 round before": "The player, with a King-high and weak flush draw, faces Qwen3. Qwen3\u2019s call, alongside folds from DeepSeek and Nvidia_Llama3_3, hints at a medium-strength hand. A small 50-chip raise is made to test Qwen3, with a willingness to fold if re-raised, reflecting the hand\u2019s vulnerability and cautious play. ",
    "1 round before": "Round 2 concluded, with Gemma3_27B declared the winner."
