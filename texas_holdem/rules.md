# Rules of Texas Hold'em Poker

Texas Hold'em is the most popular poker variant worldwide.

## Objective

The goal of Texas Hold'em is to use your hole cards in combination with community cards to make the best possible five-card poker hand. You can win either by having the strongest hand at showdown or by making all other players fold through betting and bluffing.

## Game Setup

### Players and Cards

- 2 to 10 players per table using a standard 52-card deck
- Each player receives 2 private cards (hole cards) dealt face down
- 5 community cards are dealt face up on the board for all players to share

### Table Positions

The dealer button rotates clockwise after each hand, determining the order of play. The two players to the left of the button must post forced bets called blinds:
- **Small blind**: Posted by the player immediately left of the button
- **Big blind**: Posted by the next player (typically twice the small blind amount)

## Betting Actions

Players have five possible actions during betting rounds:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fold** | Discard cards and exit the hand, losing any bets made |
| **Check** | Pass without betting (only when no bet has been made) |
| **Call** | Match the current bet amount |
| **Raise** | Increase the current bet |
| **All-in** | Bet all remaining chips |

## The Four Betting Rounds

### 1. Pre-flop
- Each player receives two hole cards face down
- Betting begins with the player to the left of the big blind
- Players act clockwise, deciding whether to fold, call the big blind, or raise

### 2. The Flop
- Three community cards are dealt face up
- A new betting round begins with the active player immediately clockwise from the button
- Players can check if no bet has been made, or bet, call, raise, or fold

### 3. The Turn
- A fourth community card is dealt face up
- Another betting round follows the same pattern as the flop
- This card is sometimes called "Fourth Street"

### 4. The River
- The fifth and final community card is dealt face up
- The final betting round takes place
- This card is also known as "Fifth Street"

## Showdown and Winning

### When Showdown Occurs

If two or more players remain after the final betting round, a showdown occurs. The last person to bet or raise shows their cards first, unless there was no bet on the final round, in which case the player immediately clockwise from the button shows first.

### Determining the Winner

- Players make the best five-card poker hand using any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards
- The player with the strongest hand wins the pot
- In case of identical hands, the pot is divided equally among players with the best hands
- All suits are considered equal

#### Using All Seven Cards
The most important principle in Texas Hold'em hand evaluation is that you use the best five cards available among all seven cards. This means you can use any combination of your two hole cards and the five community cards - you can even use zero hole cards if the board plays better than any combination with your hole cards.

### Poker Hand Rankings

The strength of poker hands follows a strict hierarchy from strongest to weakest[1]:

| Rank | Hand Type | Example | Description |
|------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Royal Flush** | A♦ K♦ Q♦ J♦ T♦ | A, K, Q, J, 10 all of the same suit |
| 2 | **Straight Flush** | T♥ 9♥ 8♥ 7♥ 6♥ | Five consecutive cards of the same suit |
| 3 | **Four-of-a-Kind** | J♦ J♣ J♠ J♥ K♦ | Four cards of equal value plus one side card |
| 4 | **Full House** | A♥ A♣ A♦ 9♠ 9♣ | Three cards of one value and two of another |
| 5 | **Flush** | A♠ J♠ 8♠ 4♠ 3♠ | Five cards of the same suit |
| 6 | **Straight** | 9♥ 8♠ 7♣ 6♦ 5♣ | Five consecutive cards of different suits |
| 7 | **Three-of-a-Kind** | 7♠ 7♦ 7♣ K♦ Q♣ | Three cards of the same value plus two side cards |
| 8 | **Two Pair** | 9♣ 9♦ 6♣ 6♠ Q♥ | Two pairs of different values plus one side card |
| 9 | **One Pair** | A♦ A♥ K♠ 9♦ 4♥ | Two cards of the same value plus three side cards |
| 10 | **High Card** | A♠ J♦ 8♣ 6♠ 2♥ | Five unconnected cards of different suits |

### Tie-Breaking Procedures

When multiple players have the same hand type, specific tie-breaking rules determine the winner:

#### High Card and One Pair
Compare cards from highest to lowest until a difference is found. For pairs, compare the pair first, then the remaining cards in descending order.

#### Two Pair
Compare the higher pair first, then the lower pair, and finally the fifth card (kicker).

#### Three-of-a-Kind
Compare the three matching cards first, then the two remaining cards in descending order.

#### Straight
The straight with the highest top card wins. Note that Ace-high straight (A-K-Q-J-10) beats all others, while Ace-low straight (A-2-3-4-5) is the lowest possible straight.

#### Flush
Compare all five cards in descending order, starting with the highest card.

#### Full House
Compare the three matching cards first, then the pair. For example, K-K-K-7-7 beats Q-Q-Q-A-A because kings beat queens in the three-card portion.

#### Four-of-a-Kind
Compare the four matching cards first, then the fifth card (kicker). Example: A-A-A-A-Q beats K-K-K-K-6 because four aces beat four kings.

#### Straight Flush and Royal Flush
For straight flushes, compare the highest card in the sequence. Royal flushes are all equal since they're all A-K-Q-J-10 of the same suit.

### Alternative Ways to Win

- If all players fold during any betting round, the remaining player wins the pot immediately without showing cards
- This allows for bluffing - betting with weak hands to make opponents fold stronger hands

## Key Rules and Procedures

### Betting Limits

Texas Hold'em is typically played as a no-limit game, meaning players can bet any amount up to their total chip stack. The minimum bet equals the big blind amount.

### Dealer Procedures

- The dealer burns (discards) one card before dealing the flop, turn, and river to prevent players from seeing the next card
- Cards are dealt clockwise starting with the small blind

### Live Blinds

The blinds are considered "live" bets, meaning they count toward the betting action. If all players call to the big blind, that player may check or raise.
